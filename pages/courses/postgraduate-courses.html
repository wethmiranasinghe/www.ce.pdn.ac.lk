<h3>Postgraduate Research Degrees in Computer Engineering</h3>

<p>
    The Department of Computer Engineering is accepting applications for Postgraduate Research Programmes in relevant
    fields. The research-based degrees offered by the Faculty of Engineering are Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) and
    Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). Postgraduate research programmes are based entirely on research and completion of a
    dissertation under the guidance of one or more supervisors.
