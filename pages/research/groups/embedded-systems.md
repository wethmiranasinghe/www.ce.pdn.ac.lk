The Embedded Systems and Computer Architecture Laboratory (ESCAL) is a research group at the Department of Computer Engineering at the University of Peradeniya. The primary focus of the group is inclined towards micro-architectural design aspects of embedded microprocessors and their security and reliability concerns. More information can be found in ESCAL official website ([http://escal.ce.pdn.ac.lk/](http://escal.ce.pdn.ac.lk/)).

The group is led by Roshan Ragel and has continued collaborations with Professor Sri Parameswaran at the Embedded Systems Lab,School of Computer Science and Engineering, the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney.

The group consists of the academic staff members of the Department of Computer Engineering, the Postgraduate (Ph.D., M.Phil., M.Eng., and M.Sc.) students from both the Department of Computer Engineering and the Postgraduate Institute of Science (PGIS), and the Undergraduate students from the Department of Computer Engineering and the Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The group also collaborates with the academic staff members, postdoctoral researchers and postgraduate students from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, UNSW. Roshan Ragel regularly visits UNSW, Sydney, as a visiting research fellow.
